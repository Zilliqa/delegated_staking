# Delegated Staking

This repository contains the contracts and scripts needed to create a staking pool that users can delegate to. Currently, the contracts exist in two variants:
1. When delegating stake to the **liquid variant**, users receive a non-rebasing liquid staking token (LST) that anyone can send to the validator's contract later on to withdraw the stake plus the corresponding share of the validator rewards.
1. When delegating stake to the **non-liquid variant**, the users can regularly withdraw their share of the rewards without withdrawing their stake.


## Prerequisites

To deploy and interact with the contracts throught the CLI, use the Forge scripts provided in this repository and described further below. First, install Foundry (https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) and the OpenZeppelin contracts before proceeding with the deployment:
```
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable --no-commit
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
```

Set the `FOUNDRY_ETH_RPC_URL` environment variable to point to your RPC node:
```bash
export FOUNDRY_ETH_RPC_URL=http://localhost:4202
```

Alternatively, you can specify the RPC in each command below by adding the following option
```bash
--rpc-url http://localhost:4202
```

## Contract Deployment

The delegation contract manages the stake delegated to the staking pool. It acts as the validator node's control address and interacts with the Zilliqa 2.0 protocol's deposit contract.

`BaseDelegation` is an abstract contract that concrete implementations inherit from.
`LiquidDelegation` implements the liquid staking variant, which deploys a `NonRebasingLST` contract when it is initialized. `NonLiquidDelegation` implements the non-liquid staking variant, which allows delegators to withdraw rewards.

Before running the deployment script, set the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable to the private key of the contract owner. Note that only the contract owner will be able to upgrade the contract, change the commission rate and activate the node as a validator.

To deploy `LiquidDelegation` run
```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "liquidDelegation(string,string)" Name Symbol
```
using the `Name` and the `Symbol` of your LST.

To deploy ``NonLiquidDelegation` run
```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "nonLiquidDelegation()"
```

You will see an output like this:
```
  Signer is 0x15fc323DFE5D5DCfbeEdc25CEcbf57f676634d77
  Proxy deployed: 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 
  Implementation deployed: 0x7C623e01c5ce2e313C223ef2aEc1Ae5C6d12D9DD
  Owner is 0x15fc323DFE5D5DCfbeEdc25CEcbf57f676634d77
  Upgraded to version: 0.3.6
```

You will need the proxy address from the above output in all commands below. If you know the address of a proxy contract but don't know which variant of staking it supports, run
```bash
forge script script/CheckVariant.s.sol --sig "run(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2
```
The output will be `ILiquidStaking`, `INonLiquidStaking` or none of them if the address is not a valid delegation contract.

You can upgrade the contract to the latest version by running
```bash
forge script script/Upgrade.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2
```

The output will look like this:
```
  Signer is 0x15fc323DFE5D5DCfbeEdc25CEcbf57f676634d77
  Upgrading from version: 0.3.5
  Owner is 0x15fc323DFE5D5DCfbeEdc25CEcbf57f676634d77
  New implementation deployed: 0x64Fa96a67910956141cc481a43f242C045c10165
  Upgraded to version: 0.3.6
```

If you want to check the current version your contract was upgraded to, run
```bash
forge script script/CheckVersion.s.sol --sig "run(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2
```

To adapt the contract to your needs, create your own copy of `LiquidDelegation` or `NonLiquidDelegation` and run the above upgrade script again.


## Contract Configuration

Now or at a later time you can set the commission on the rewards the validator earns to e.g. 10% as follows:
```bash
forge script script/Configure.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "commissionRate(address payable, uint16)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 1000
```

The output will contain the following information:
```
  Running version: 0.3.6
  Commission rate: 0.0%
  New commission rate: 10.0%
```

If you only want to view the current commission rate and leave it unchanged, run
```bash
forge script script/Configure.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "commissionRate(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2
```

Note that the commission rate is specified as an integer to be divided by the `DENOMINATOR` which can be retrieved from the delegation contract:
```bash
cast call 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 "DENOMINATOR()(uint256)"  | sed 's/\[[^]]*\]//g'
```

Once the validator is activated and starts earning rewards, the commission is deducted and transferred automatically. The commission of a non-liquid staking pool is deducted when delegators withdraw or stake rewards. In case of a liquid staking pool, the commission is deducted each time delegators stake, unstake or claim what they unstaked, or when the contract owner requests the outstanding commission that hasn't been transferred yet. To collect the outstanding commission, run
```bash
forge script script/CollectCommission.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2
```

By default, the commission is transferred to the original contract owner. The current contract owner can change the address to which the commission is transferred by running
```bash
forge script script/Configure.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "commissionReceiver(address payable, address)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 0xeA78aAE5Be606D2D152F00760662ac321aB8F017
```

The output will contain the following information:
```
  Running version: 0.3.6
  Commission receiver: 0x15fc323DFE5D5DCfbeEdc25CEcbf57f676634d77
  New commission receiver: 0xeA78aAE5Be606D2D152F00760662ac321aB8F017
```

Using the above command the commission can be redirected to a cold wallet, a multisig wallet or a smart contract which splits the commission proportionally to the deposit of the validators who join the staking pool.

If you only want to view the current commission receiver and leave it unchanged, run
```bash
forge script script/Configure.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "commissionReceiver(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2
```


## Validator Addition and Removal

If your node has already been activated as a validator i.e. solo staker, it can join a staking pool. Run
```bash
cast send --legacy --private-key 0x... \
0x00000000005a494c4445504f53495450524f5859 "setControlAddress(bytes,address)" \
0x92fbe50544dce63cfdcc88301d7412f0edea024c91ae5d6a04c7cd3819edfc1b9d75d9121080af12e00f054d221f876c \
0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2
```
using the private key that you used to deposit your node, the BLS public key of your node and the address of the staking pool's delegation contract. Afterwards the staking pool contract owner must run
```bash
cast send --legacy --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
0x7a0b7e6d24ede78260c9ddbd98e828b0e11a8ea2 "join(bytes,address)" \
0x92fbe50544dce63cfdcc88301d7412f0edea024c91ae5d6a04c7cd3819edfc1b9d75d9121080af12e00f054d221f876c \
0xe0c6f3d59b8cda6ce4fd66418212404a63ad8517
```
using the BLS public key and the original control address that you used when you deposited the node. 

To leave a staking pool, run 
```bash
cast send --legacy --private-key 0x... \
0x7a0b7e6d24ede78260c9ddbd98e828b0e11a8ea2 "leave(bytes)" \
0x92fbe50544dce63cfdcc88301d7412f0edea024c91ae5d6a04c7cd3819edfc1b9d75d9121080af12e00f054d221f876c
```
using the private key that you used to deposit your node, the BLS public key of your node and the address of the staking pool's delegation contract. Note that your validator can't leave the staking pool as long as there are pending stake withdrawals. The following event emitted by the above transaction indicates whether it was successful or not:
```solidity
event ValidatorLeaving(bytes indexed blsPubKey, bool success);
```

If it wasn't, use the following command to check if the validator has pending withdrawals and repeat the above command when the query returns `false`:
```bash
cast call 0x7a0b7e6d24ede78260c9ddbd98e828b0e11a8ea2 "pendingWithdrawals(bytes)(bool)" \
0x92fbe50544dce63cfdcc88301d7412f0edea024c91ae5d6a04c7cd3819edfc1b9d75d9121080af12e00f054d221f876c
```

If the validator's deposit was lower than the value of your LST balance or staked ZIL then you can claim the difference after the unbonding period as explained in the section about unstaking. If the the validator's deposit was higher, then it can't leave the staking pool yet. First, its deposit is automatically reduced to the value of your LST balance or staked ZIL and the difference is redistributed among the validators remaining in the staking pool after the unbonding period. During the unbonding period i.e. before the redistribution, unstaking of larger amounts might fail if the remaining validators' deposits are insufficient to cover the amount to be unstaked. To complete the leaving of your validator, run the following command as soon as the unbonding period is over:
```bash
cast send --legacy --private-key 0x... \
0x7a0b7e6d24ede78260c9ddbd98e828b0e11a8ea2 "completeLeaving(bytes)" \
0x92fbe50544dce63cfdcc88301d7412f0edea024c91ae5d6a04c7cd3819edfc1b9d75d9121080af12e00f054d221f876c
```
After leaving the staking pool, your node will remain a validator.

If you don't have an activated validator node yet, but have already deployed a delegation contract and your balance as the contract owner cover the required minimum stake, you can make a fully synced node the first validator of your staking pool by submitting a transaction with e.g. 10 million ZIL through
```bash
cast send --legacy --value 10000000ether --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
0x7a0b7e6d24ede78260c9ddbd98e828b0e11a8ea2 "deposit(bytes,bytes,bytes)" \
0x92fbe50544dce63cfdcc88301d7412f0edea024c91ae5d6a04c7cd3819edfc1b9d75d9121080af12e00f054d221f876c \
0x002408011220d5ed74b09dcbe84d3b32a56c01ab721cf82809848b6604535212a219d35c412f \
0xb14832a866a49ddf8a3104f8ee379d29c136f29aeb8fccec9d7fb17180b99e8ed29bee2ada5ce390cb704bc6fd7f5ce814f914498376c4b8bc14841a57ae22279769ec8614e2673ba7f36edc5a4bf5733aa9d70af626279ee2b2cde939b4bd8a
```
with the BLS public key, the peer id and the BLS signature of the node. Note that the peer id must be converted from base58 to hexadecimal format and you must provide the delegation contract address when generating the BLS signature:
```bash
echo '{"secret_key":"...", "chain_id":..., "control_address":"0x7a0b7e6d24ede78260c9ddbd98e828b0e11a8ea2"}' | cargo run --bin convert-key
```

Even if you don't own the required minimum stake to deposit a validator, your delegation contract can start collecting delegated stake and as soon as its funds plus your balance cover the required minimum stake, you can activate a fully synced node as your first validator by providing e.g. 5 million ZIL in addition to your delegation contract's funds in the command introduced above:
```bash
cast send --legacy --value 5000000ether --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
0x7a0b7e6d24ede78260c9ddbd98e828b0e11a8ea2 "deposit(bytes,bytes,bytes)" \
0x92fbe50544dce63cfdcc88301d7412f0edea024c91ae5d6a04c7cd3819edfc1b9d75d9121080af12e00f054d221f876c \
0x002408011220d5ed74b09dcbe84d3b32a56c01ab721cf82809848b6604535212a219d35c412f \
0xb14832a866a49ddf8a3104f8ee379d29c136f29aeb8fccec9d7fb17180b99e8ed29bee2ada5ce390cb704bc6fd7f5ce814f914498376c4b8bc14841a57ae22279769ec8614e2673ba7f36edc5a4bf5733aa9d70af626279ee2b2cde939b4bd8a
```

Note that the reward address registered for the validator node will be the address of the delegation contract (the proxy contract to be more precise), but the deposit will not take effect and the node will not start to earn rewards until the epoch after next.


## Staking and Unstaking

Once the delegation contract has been deployed and upgraded to the latest version, it can accept delegations. In order to stake e.g. 200 ZIL, run
```bash
forge script script/Stake.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable, uint256)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 200000000000000000000 --private-key 0x...
```
with the private key of delegator account. It's important to make sure the account's balance can cover the transaction fees plus the 200 ZIL to be delegated.

The output will look like this for liquid staking:
```
  Running version: 0.3.6
  Current stake: 10000000000000000000000000 wei
  Current rewards: 110314207650273223687 wei
  LST address: 0x9e5c257D1c6dF74EaA54e58CdccaCb924669dc83
  Staker balance before: 99899145245801454561224 wei 0 LST
  Staker balance after: 99699145245801454561224 wei 199993793908430833324 LST
```
and like this for the non-liquid variant:
```
  Running version: 0.3.6
  Current stake: 10000000000000000000000000 wei
  Current rewards: 110314207650273223687 wei
  Staker balance before: 99899145245801454561224 wei
  Staker balance after: 99699145245801454561224 wei
```

Due to the fact that the above output was generated based on the local script execution before the transaction got submitted to the network, the ZIL balance does not reflect the gas fees of the staking transaction and the LST balance is also different from the actual LST balance which you can query by running
```bash
cast call $(cast call 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 "getLST()(address)") "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" 0xd819fFcE7A58b1E835c25617Db7b46a00888B013 | sed 's/\[[^]]*\]//g'
```

Copy the LST address from the above output and add it to your wallet if you want to transfer liquid staking tokens to another account.

To query the current price of an LST, run
```bash
cast to-unit $(cast call 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 "getPrice()(uint256)" --block latest | sed 's/\[[^]]*\]//g') ether
```

To unstake e.g. 100 LST (liquid variant) or 100 ZIL (non-liquid variant), run
```bash
forge script script/Unstake.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable, uint256)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 100000000000000000000 --private-key 0x...
```
using the private key of an account that holds some LST in case of the liquid variant or using the private key of the delegator account in case of the non-liquid variant.

The output will look like this for liquid staking:
```
  Running version: 0.3.6
  Current stake: 10000000000000000000000000 wei
  Current rewards: 331912568306010928520 wei
  LST address: 0x9e5c257D1c6dF74EaA54e58CdccaCb924669dc83
  Staker balance before: 99698814298179759361224 wei 199993784619390291653 LST
  Staker balance after: 99698814298179759361224 wei 99993784619390291653 LST
```
and like this for the non-liquid variant:
```
  Running version: 0.3.6
  Current stake: 10000000000000000000000000 wei
  Current rewards: 331912568306010928520 wei
  Staker balance before: 99698814298179759361224 wei
  Staker balance after: 99698814298179759361224 wei
```

The ZIL balance hasn't increased yet because the unstaked amount can not be transferred immediately. To claim the unstaked amount after the unbonding period, run
```bash
forge script script/Claim.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 --private-key 0x...
```
with the private key of the account that unstaked in the previous step.

The output will look like this:
```
  Running version: 0.3.6
  Staker balance before: 99698086421983460161224 wei
  Staker balance after: 99798095485861371162343 wei
```

To query how much ZIL you can already claim, run
```bash
cast to-unit $(cast call 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 "getClaimable()(uint256)" --from 0xd819fFcE7A58b1E835c25617Db7b46a00888B013 --block latest | sed 's/\[[^]]*\]//g') ether
```
with the address of the account that unstaked above as an argument.

Note that if a delegation contract represents a staking pool with multiple validators, each staking and unstaking will increase and decrease all validators' deposit proportionally to their current deposit. In case an unstaking would reduce a validator's deposit below the required minimum, the validator will be forced to leave the staking pool as soon as its pending unstaked deposit is withdrawn by the delegation contract.

Of course, delegators will not be using the CLI to stake, unstake and claim their funds. To enable delegators to access your staking pool through the staking portal maintained by the Zilliqa team, get in touch and provide your delegation contract address once you have set up the validator node and delegation contract. If you want to integrate staking into your dapp, see the [Development and Testing](#development-and-testing) section below.


## Withdrawing or Staking Rewards

In the liquid staking variant, you as the node operator can stake the rewards accrued by the node. To do so, run
```bash
forge script script/StakeRewards.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 --private-key 0x...
```

In the non-liquid variant of staking, delegators can stake or withdraw their share of the rewards. To query the amount of rewards available, run
```bash
cast to-unit $(cast call 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 "rewards()(uint256)" --from 0xd819fFcE7A58b1E835c25617Db7b46a00888B013 --block latest | sed 's/\[[^]]*\]//g') ether
```

If a delegator hasn't withdrawn rewards while thousands of delegators staked or unstaked, the gas used by the above function might hit the block limit. In this case it's possible to withdraw only the rewards accrued during the next `n` subsequent stakings or unstaking that have not been withdrawn yet. This can be repeated several times to withdraw all rewards using multiple transactions. To calculate the rewards that can be withdrawn in the next transaction, choose a number `0 <= n <= 11000` e.g. `100` and run
```bash
cast to-unit $(cast call 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 "rewards(uint64)(uint256)" 100 --from 0xd819fFcE7A58b1E835c25617Db7b46a00888B013 --block latest | sed 's/\[[^]]*\]//g') ether
```
Note that `n` actually denotes the number of additional stakings or unstakings so that at least one is always reflected in the result, even if you specify `n = 0`.

You can also specify the exact amount you want to withdraw. To withdraw e.g. 1 ZIL using `n = 100`, run
```bash
forge script script/WithdrawRewards.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable, string, string)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 1000000000000000000 100 --private-key 0x...
```
with the private key of a delegator account. To withdraw as much as possible using a specified `n` set the amount to `all`. To withdraw the specified amount without specifying `n` replace `n` with `all`. To withdraw all rewards replace both the amount and `n` with `all`.

Last but not least, in order to stake rewards instead of withdrawing them, run
```bash
forge script script/StakeRewards.s.sol --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 --private-key 0x...
```
using the private key of their account.


## Development and Testing

Staking pool operators are encouraged to fork and adapt the above contracts to implement features such as instant unstaking for a premium fee, automated staking of rewards to achieve the best possible APR or issuing a rebasing liquid staking token with a constant price of 1 ZIL but holder balances adjusted according to the rewards accrued.

The tests included in this repository should also be adjusted and extended accordingly. They can be executed by running
```bash
unset FOUNDRY_ETH_RPC_URL
forge test
```
or
```bash
unset FOUNDRY_ETH_RPC_URL
forge test -vv
```
if you want to see the values calculated in the tests.

To enable the tests to interact with the Zilliqa 2.0 deposit contract, the contract must be compiled along with the test contracts. Specify the folder containing the Solidity file in `remappings.txt`:
```
@zilliqa/zq2/=/home/user/zq2/zilliqa/src/contracts/
```

To execute end-to-end tests on a local network, run
```bash
chmod +x e2e_liquid.sh && ./e2e_liquid.sh
chmod +x e2e_non-liquid.sh && ./e2e_non-liquid.sh
```

The scripts start a network of 4 validators, deploy the delegation contract of a staking pool, make the validators join the staking pool, perform staking, unstaking and claiming of unstaked funds, staking of rewards as well as withdrawing rewards in case of the non-liquid variant, and finally remove the validators from the staking pool.


The following bash scripts with verbose output can be used to test staking, unstaking and claiming of unstaked funds as well as withdrawing and staking of rewards and to print the current state of a delegator's stake queried from the validator's local node. Their output is useful for checking the results of these operations. Here a few examples of how to use them (private key replaced with `0x...`):
```bash
# stake 200 ZIL
chmod +x stake.sh && ./stake.sh 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 0x... 200000000000000000000

# unstake 100 ZIL

Use the events and methods defined in the `IDeposit` interface and the `BaseDelegation` contract to integrate Zilliqa 2.0 staking into your dapp:
```solidity
event Staked(address indexed delegator, uint256 amount, bytes data);
event Unstaked(address indexed delegator, uint256 amount, bytes data);
event Claimed(address indexed delegator, uint256 amount, bytes data);

function stake() external payable;
function unstake(uint256) external returns(uint256 unstakedZil);
function claim() external;

function unbondingPeriod() external virtual view returns(uint256 numberOfBlocks);
function getClaimable() external virtual view returns(uint256 total);
function getPendingClaims() external virtual view returns(uint256[2][] memory blockNumbersAndAmounts);
function getMinDelegation() external view returns(uint256 amount);
function getCommission() external view returns(uint256 numerator, uint256 denominator);
function getStake() external view returns(uint256 validatorStake);
```

There are additional events and methods applicable only to a specific staking variant such as
```solidity
function getLST() external view returns(address erc20Contract);
function getPrice() external view returns(uint256 oneTokenToZil);
```
for liquid staking and
```solidity
event RewardPaid(address indexed delegator, uint256 reward);

function getDelegatedAmount() external view returns(uint256 result);
function getDelegatedTotal() external view returns(uint256 result);
function setNewAddress(address to) external;
function replaceOldAddress(address old) external;
function rewards() external view returns(uint256 total);
function withdrawAllRewards() external returns(uint256 taxedRewards);
function withdrawRewards(uint256 amount) external returns(uint256 taxedRewards);
function stakeRewards() external;
```
and a few more for the non-liquid variant.

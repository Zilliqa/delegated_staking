# Liquid Staking

This repo contains the contracts and scripts needed to activate a validator that users can stake ZIL with. When delegating stake, users receive a non-rebasing **liquid staking token** (LST) that anyone can send to the validator's delegation contract later on to withdraw the staked ZIL plus the corresponding share of the validator rewards.

Install Foundry (https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) and the OpenZeppelin contracts before proceeding with the deployment:
```
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable --no-commit
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
```

## Contract Deployment
The delegation contract is used by delegators to stake and unstake ZIL with the respective validator. It acts as the validator node's control address and interacts with the `Deposit` system contract. `Delegation` is the initial implementation of the delegation contract that creates a `NonRebasingLST` contract when it is initialized. `DelegationV2` implements staking, unstaking and other features.

The delegation contract shall be deployed and upgraded by the account with the private key that was used to run the validator node and was used to generate its BLS keypair and peer id. Make sure the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable is set accordingly.

To deploy `Delegation` run
```bash
forge script script/deploy_Delegation.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:4201 --broadcast --legacy
```
You will see an output like this:
```
  Signer is 0x15fc323DFE5D5DCfbeEdc25CEcbf57f676634d77
  Proxy deployed: 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 
  Implementation deployed: 0x7C623e01c5ce2e313C223ef2aEc1Ae5C6d12D9DD
  Deployed version: 1
  Owner is 0x15fc323DFE5D5DCfbeEdc25CEcbf57f676634d77
```

You will need the proxy address from the above output in all commands below.

To upgrade the contract to `DelegationV2`, run
```bash
forge script script/upgrade_Delegation.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:4201 --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2
```

The output will look like this:
```
  Signer is 0x15fc323DFE5D5DCfbeEdc25CEcbf57f676634d77
  Upgrading from version: 1
  Owner is 0x15fc323DFE5D5DCfbeEdc25CEcbf57f676634d77
  New implementation deployed: 0x64Fa96a67910956141cc481a43f242C045c10165
  Upgraded to version: 2
```

## Contract Configuration

Now or at a later time you can set the commission on the rewards the validator earns to e.g. 10% as follows:
```bash
forge script script/commission_Delegation.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:4201 --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable, uint16)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 1000
```

The output will contain the following information:
```
  Running version: 2
  LST address: 0x9e5c257D1c6dF74EaA54e58CdccaCb924669dc83
  Old commission rate: 0.0%
  New commission rate: 10.0%
```

Note that the commission rate is specified as an integer to be devided by the `DENOMINATOR` which can be retrieved from the delegation contract:
```bash
cast call 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 "DENOMINATOR()(uint256)" --rpc-url http://localhost:4201  | sed 's/\[[^]]*\]//g'
```

## Validator Activation
If you node's account has enough ZIL for the minimum stake required, you can activate your node as a validator with a deposit of e.g. 10 million ZIL. Run
```bash
cast send --legacy --value 10000000ether --rpc-url http://localhost:4201 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
0x7a0b7e6d24ede78260c9ddbd98e828b0e11a8ea2 "deposit(bytes,bytes,bytes)" \
0x92fbe50544dce63cfdcc88301d7412f0edea024c91ae5d6a04c7cd3819edfc1b9d75d9121080af12e00f054d221f876c \
0x002408011220d5ed74b09dcbe84d3b32a56c01ab721cf82809848b6604535212a219d35c412f \
0xb14832a866a49ddf8a3104f8ee379d29c136f29aeb8fccec9d7fb17180b99e8ed29bee2ada5ce390cb704bc6fd7f5ce814f914498376c4b8bc14841a57ae22279769ec8614e2673ba7f36edc5a4bf5733aa9d70af626279ee2b2cde939b4bd8a
```
with the BLS public key, the peer id and the BLS signature of your node. Note that the peer id must be converted from base58 to hex. Make sure your node is fully synced before you run the above command.

Note that the reward address registered for your validator node will be the address of the delegation contract (the proxy contract to be more precise).

Alternatively, you can proceed to the next section and delegate stake until the contract's balance reaches the 10 million ZIL minimum stake required for the activation, and then run
```bash
cast send --legacy --rpc-url http://localhost:4201 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
0x7a0b7e6d24ede78260c9ddbd98e828b0e11a8ea2 "deposit2(bytes,bytes,bytes)" \
0x92fbe50544dce63cfdcc88301d7412f0edea024c91ae5d6a04c7cd3819edfc1b9d75d9121080af12e00f054d221f876c \
0x002408011220d5ed74b09dcbe84d3b32a56c01ab721cf82809848b6604535212a219d35c412f \
0xb14832a866a49ddf8a3104f8ee379d29c136f29aeb8fccec9d7fb17180b99e8ed29bee2ada5ce390cb704bc6fd7f5ce814f914498376c4b8bc14841a57ae22279769ec8614e2673ba7f36edc5a4bf5733aa9d70af626279ee2b2cde939b4bd8a
```
to deposit all of it.

## Staking and Unstaking
If the above transaction was successful and the node became a validator, it can accept delegations. In order to stake e.g. 200 ZIL, run 
```bash
forge script script/stake_Delegation.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:4201 --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable, uint256)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 200000000000000000000 --private-key 0x...
```
with the private key of the delegator account. Make sure the account's balance can cover the transaction fees plus the 200 ZIL to be delegated.

The output will look like this:
```
  Running version: 2
  Current stake: 10000000000000000000000000 wei
  Current rewards: 110314207650273223687 wei
  LST address: 0x9e5c257D1c6dF74EaA54e58CdccaCb924669dc83
  Owner balance: 10000000000000000000000000 LST
  Staker balance before: 99899145245801454561224 wei 0 LST
  Staker balance after: 99699145245801454561224 wei 199993793908430833324 LST
```

Note that the staker LST balance in the output will be different from the actual LST balance which you can query by running
```bash
cast call 0x9e5c257D1c6dF74EaA54e58CdccaCb924669dc83 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" 0xd819fFcE7A58b1E835c25617Db7b46a00888B013 --rpc-url http://localhost:4201  | sed 's/\[[^]]*\]//g'
```
This is due to the fact that the above output was generated based on the local script execution before the transaction got submitted to the network.

You can copy the LST address from the above output and add it to your wallet to transfer your liquid staking tokens to another account if you want to.

To query the current price of an LST, run
```bash
cast to-unit $(cast call 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 "getPrice()(uint256)" --block latest --rpc-url http://localhost:4201 | sed 's/\[[^]]*\]//g') ether
```

To unstake e.g. 100 LST, run
```bash
forge script script/unstake_Delegation.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:4201 --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable, uint256)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 100000000000000000000 --private-key 0x...
```
with the private key of an account that holds some LST.

The output will look like this:
```
  Running version: 2
  Current stake: 10000000000000000000000000 wei
  Current rewards: 331912568306010928520 wei
  LST address: 0x9e5c257D1c6dF74EaA54e58CdccaCb924669dc83
  Owner balance: 10000000000000000000000000 LST
  Staker balance before: 99698814298179759361224 wei 199993784619390291653 LST
  Staker balance after: 99698814298179759361224 wei 99993784619390291653 LST
```

Last but not least, to claim the amount that is available after the unbonding period, run
```bash
forge script script/claim_Delegation.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:4201 --broadcast --legacy --sig "run(address payable)" 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 --private-key 0x...
```
with the private key of an account that unstaked some LST.

The output will look like this:
```
  Running version: 2
  Staker balance before: 99698086421983460161224 wei
  Staker balance after: 99798095485861371162343 wei
```

To query how much ZIL you can already claim, run
```bash
cast to-unit $(cast call 0x7A0b7e6D24eDe78260c9ddBD98e828B0e11A8EA2 "getClaimable()(uint256)" --from 0xd819fFcE7A58b1E835c25617Db7b46a00888B013 --block latest --rpc-url http://localhost:4201 | sed 's/\[[^]]*\]//g') ether
```
